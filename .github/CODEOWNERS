# CODEOWNERS file
# This file defines code owners for the repository. Code owners are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests that modify files they own.
#
# Format:
# Each line consists of a file pattern followed by one or more GitHub usernames or teams (e.g., @org/team or @username).
# Example:  docs/ @docs-team
#
# The pattern '*' means all files in the repository.
# To override ownership for a specific directory or file, add a more specific pattern below the global rule.
# Example:
#   * @global-team
#   docs/ @docs-team
#   docs/special.md @specialist
#
* @coreweave/cloud-platform-api-iam
