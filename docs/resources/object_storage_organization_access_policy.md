## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the organization access policy, must be unique.
- `statements` (Attributes Set) The list of access policy statements associated with this policy. At least one statement is required. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--statements))

<a id="nestedatt--statements"></a>
### Nested Schema for `statements`

Required:

- `actions` (Set of String) Defines which operations the policy allows or denies. Organization access policies can include actions from two APIs - S3 (s3:*) and AI Object Storage API (cwobject:*). You can use wildcards (like s3:* or cwobject:*) to cover multiple actions at once.
- `effect` (String) Must be either Allow or Deny (case-sensitive). Determines whether the statement grants or denies the specified actions on the listed resources for the designated principals. By default, all access is denied.
- `name` (String) A short, human-readable identifier for this specific policy statement, similar to Sid in bucket access policies.
- `principals` (Set of String) Defines which users, roles, or groups the policy applies to. Only short-form identifiers are supported. If you use a full ARN, the policy will fail with an error. See the [AI Object Storage documentation](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/concepts/policies/organization-policies#resources) for guidelines on defining principals.
- `resources` (Set of String) Defines which resources the policy applies to. See the [AI Object Storage documentation](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/concepts/policies/organization-policies#resources) for guidelines on defining resources.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import coreweave_object_storage_organization_access_policy.default {{name}}
```
