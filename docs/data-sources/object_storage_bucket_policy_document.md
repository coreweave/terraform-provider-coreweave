  Bucket access policies https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/auth-access/bucket-access/bucket-policies allow you to define precise, S3-compatible access control for one bucket. They are evaluated after organization access policies. See Manage Bucket Policies https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/auth-access/bucket-access/manage-bucket-policies#example-policies for examples and further information.

# coreweave_object_storage_bucket_policy_document (Data Source)

[Bucket access policies](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/auth-access/bucket-access/bucket-policies) allow you to define precise, S3-compatible access control for one bucket. They are evaluated after organization access policies. See [Manage Bucket Policies](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/auth-access/bucket-access/manage-bucket-policies#example-policies) for examples and further information. This data source provides a type-safe data structure for creating an S3-compatible JSON bucket policy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "coreweave_object_storage_bucket_policy_document" "default" {
  version = "2012-10-17"
  statement {
    sid      = "allow-all"
    effect   = "Allow"
    action   = ["s3:*"]
    resource = ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
    principal = {
      "CW" : ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```
